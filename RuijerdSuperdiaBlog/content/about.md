I'm **Evan Binu Chirayath**, and I'm from Kerala's Thrissur district. I studied computer science during my higher secondary. Before I transferred to Kerala, I was in GCC for six years. I have a passion for programming and made a couple of projects using python. Currently, I'm studying at **Amrita Vishva Vidhyalam** and am trying to join amfoss as a student. I am also an amateur weight ligther.

My current PR's are:

**Deadlift**:**100KG**

**Squat**:**80KG**

**BenchPress**:**50KG**
